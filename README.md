This branch is a repo to host the (Markdown) source files of my personal website, including my Chinese and English blogs. I build my website on a flexible Jekyll Theme ([Jalpc](https://jarrekk.github.io/Jalpc/)) and GitHub Pages. The Jalpc theme is licensed under [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php), and the copyright of the content of the blogs is reserved.
